# philosopher_bot
An AI prompted to act as a specified philosopher, and act as a reading companion. 

## Running the GUI

To run the GUI for interacting with the AI assistant, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Install the required libraries if you haven't already:
   ```bash
   pip install tkinter
   pip install anthropic
   ```
3. Run the `gui.py` script:
   ```bash
   python gui.py
   ```

This will open a window where you can input the philosopher's name, the text being read, and ask questions about the text. The AI assistant will respond in the style of the specified philosopher, using the integrated API call to generate responses.
