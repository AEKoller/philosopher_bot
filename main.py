Analyze the question in relation to the provided text and the philosopher's known ideas.\n2. Formulate a response that the philosopher might give.\n3. Provide your response in the following format:\n\n<philosopher_response>\n[Your response here, written in the style of the philosopher]\n</philosopher_response>\n\n<explanation>\n[A brief explanation of how your response relates to the philosopher's ideas and style, referencing specific parts of the provided text if applicable]\n</explanation>\n\nNow, please respond to the following question as if you were the specified philosopher:\n\n<user_question>\n{{USER_QUESTION}}\n</user_question>"
